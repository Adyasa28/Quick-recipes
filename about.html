    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      QuickBites was created to help hostel students, PG residents and busy office-goers 
      cook healthy, tasty, and budget-friendly meals without spending hours in the kitchen.  
      Our recipes are simple, quick, and suited to Indian tastebuds.</p>
      <p>“This is my first version of Quick Recipes 🍳 — 
      right now it has only a few recipes, but in future I’ll add more variety and features to make it more useful.”
